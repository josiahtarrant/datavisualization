The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a drastic shift in the way people work, especially in the tech industry. As the vaccine was being rolled out, many tech companies announced their plans to return to the office. In my thesis, I am looking at 22 prominent tech companies, and how they will be returning to the office. The majority of the sample selected are providing a fully-remote option to their employees, many of the other companies are requiring a hybrid model. One company, Netflix is sticking to fully in-person working. Several companies are pursuing a combination of these options, hence the "other" category.

Data comes from mutiple sources compiled through extensive research, but one of the sources can be found [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90653268/tech-companies-hybrid-office-remote-work-policies).
